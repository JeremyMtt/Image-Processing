    "**Implement 2D convolution using Python. Complete the following tasks:**\n",
    "1. Write a 2D convolution function **CONV2**. The inputs of this function should be an image array and a filter array, and the output should be the convolved image. Your output image should have a size equal to the original image (similar to the “SAME” option of MATLAB conv2 function). For simplicity, you can assume the filter has an odd length in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and has an origin at the center. Also you can assume pixel values are zero outside the original input image.\n",
    "2. Write a main function, which will call the convolution function from **part 1)** to filter a given image with a given filter. The program should show the original image and the filtered image (**make sure to normalize the output image to lie between 0-255**). The program will also calculate and display the magnitude of Fourier transform of the original and filtered image, as well as frequency response of the filter. (In Python, you can use fft2() in numpy package)\n",
    "3. Using your main program to filter an image with the following three filters:\n",
    "![](Q_FIGURES/F1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input to the convolution function should a single channel image (e.g. gray scale).\n",
    "- Your main program can be flexible. You may allow both color and gray image as input, but if the input is color, you convert it to gray. You can use the fft2( ) function to calculate the Fourier transform and freq response. \n"
